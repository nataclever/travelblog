        <p>With 50.7 million tourists a year (2015), Italy is the fifth most visited country in international tourism arrivals, and the sixth highest tourism earner in the world. Tourism is one of Italy's fastest growing and most profitable industrial sectors,
            with an estimated revenue of €189.1 billion. People mainly visit Italy for its rich art, cuisine, history, fashion and culture, its beautiful coastline and beaches, its mountains, and priceless ancient monuments. The Roman Empire, Middle Ages,
            and renaissance have left many cultural artifacts for the Italian tourist industry to use. Many northern cities are also able to use the Alps as an attraction for winter sports, while coastal southern cities have the Mediterranean Sea to draw
            tourists looking for sun. Italy is also home to fifty UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the most in the world.</p>

            religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées that hosts several million visitors a year. France, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest and renowned museums, including the Louvre, which
            is the most visited art museum in the world, the Musée d'Orsay, mostly devoted to impressionism, and Beaubourg, dedicated to Contemporary art. Disneyland Paris is Europe's most popular theme park, with 15 million combined visitors to the resort's
            Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park in 2009. With more than 10 millions tourists a year, the French Riviera (or Côte d'Azur), in south-east France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris region.
            It benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, 115 kilometres (71 mi) of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants. Each year the Côte d'Azur hosts 50% of the world's superyacht fleet. Another major destination
